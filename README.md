# Shark-Tank-India-Analysis
Inspired by work done by [@divsoo1](https://github.com/divsoo1)

Shark Tank India is not just an entertainment-based reality show meant for passive consumption. If you watch a couple of episodes of the show, chances are you may very well be on the way to investing in any of the businesses you may have heard of. If not this, you will at least try to gather more information about what investing and entrepreneurship are about or have discussions with your friends about it. The show helps in building skills as you discover newer ways to grow your money. It's infotainment at its best. ~ 'India TV said'
